Okay, here's a step-by-step implementation guide for developing your "Floor is Lava" webcam browser game. This guide focuses on the process and milestones rather than specific code.

# Floor is Lava - Webcam Browser Game: Implementation Guide

This guide outlines the steps to create a "Floor is Lava" game that runs in a web browser using a webcam.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure

*   [x] **1.1. Create Project Folder:**
    *   [x] Create a main folder for your game (e.g., `floor-is-lava-game`).
*   [x] **1.2. Create Core HTML File (`index.html`):**
    *   [x] Set up the basic HTML structure (doctype, head, body).
    *   [x] Include a title for your game.
    *   [x] Create a `div` element to hold the webcam feed.
    *   [x] Create a `canvas` element that will be overlaid on the webcam feed for game graphics (lava, UI elements).
    *   [x] Link to your CSS file.
    *   [x] Link to your JavaScript file (usually at the end of the body).
*   [x] **1.3. Create CSS File (`style.css`):**
    *   [x] Add basic styling to position the webcam feed and canvas correctly (e.g., ensure they overlap).
    *   [x] Style any initial UI elements you might want (e.g., a start button).
*   [x] **1.4. Create JavaScript File (`script.js`):**
    *   [x] This will contain all your game logic. Start with a simple `console.log("Script loaded!");` to ensure it's linked correctly.

## Phase 2: Webcam Integration

*   [x] **2.1. Access Webcam:**
    *   [x] In `script.js`, write JavaScript to request access to the user's webcam using the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` API.
    *   [x] Handle success: If access is granted, stream the webcam feed to the `video` element you created in `index.html`.
    *   [x] Handle errors: If access is denied or no webcam is found, display an appropriate message to the user.
*   [x] **2.2. Display Webcam Feed:**
    *   [x] Ensure the live webcam stream is visible on your HTML page.
    *   [x] Adjust CSS if necessary to size and position the video feed as desired.

## Phase 3: Game Canvas & Basic Graphics

*   [x] **3.1. Setup Canvas Context:**
    *   [x] In `script.js`, get the 2D rendering context for your `canvas` element.
    *   [x] Ensure the canvas dimensions match the webcam video dimensions (or the dimensions you want for your game area).
*   [x] **3.2. Basic Drawing Test:**
    *   [x] Write a simple function to draw something on the canvas (e.g., a red rectangle) to confirm it's working and positioned correctly over the video feed.

## Phase 4: Defining the "Lava" Area

*   [x] **4.1. Determine Floor Representation:**
    *   [x] **Simple Approach:** Decide that the "lava" will occupy a fixed portion of the bottom of the webcam view (e.g., the bottom 20-30% of the canvas).
    *   [ ] **(Advanced - Optional Later):** Consider if you want to implement more complex floor detection (this can be very challenging). For now, stick to a simpler method.
*   [x] **4.2. Draw the Lava:**
    *   [x] Write a function to draw the "lava" effect on the canvas in the designated area. This could be a solid color (e.g., orange/red) or a more dynamic animated effect later.

## Phase 5: Player "Interaction" with Lava (Simplified)

*   [x] **5.1. Conceptualize Player Detection:**
    *   [x] **Initial Simple Approach:** For now, you won't be doing complex body tracking. Instead, you can define a "safe zone" at the top or middle of the screen and assume anything *not* in the lava area is the player being "safe". The "interaction" will be a loss condition if the player *fails* to stay out of a virtual "lava" trigger area.
    *   [x] **Alternative Simple Approach (Manual Trigger):** Use mouse clicks or specific keyboard presses to simulate the player "touching" the lava for testing game over logic.
*   [ ] **5.2. (Placeholder for Future Motion Detection):**
    *   [ ] Make a note here: *Actual player detection through image processing (e.g., detecting if feet are in the lava zone) is a more advanced step. For now, we'll focus on the game logic assuming we *can* detect this.*
    *   [ ] For development, you might temporarily use the mouse position over the canvas: if the mouse enters the "lava" area, trigger the "game over" state. This allows you to build the game logic without complex computer vision yet.

## Phase 6: Game State Management

*   [x] **6.1. Define Game States:**
    *   [x] Identify the different states of your game (e.g., `StartScreen`, `Playing`, `GameOver`).
*   [x] **6.1. Create Game State Variables:**
    *   [x] Define variables to track game state (e.g., `gameActive`, `gameOver`, `score`, `timer`).
    *   [x] Create functions to handle state transitions (start game, end game, restart).
*   [x] **6.2. Implement Start Game Logic:**
    *   [x] Create a "Start Game" button or trigger.
    *   [x] When started, transition the game state to `Playing`.
    *   [x] Initialize game variables (score, timer).
    *   [x] Start the game loop/animation loop.
*   [x] **6.3. Create Game Loop:**
    *   [x] Set up a main game loop using `requestAnimationFrame`.
    *   [x] In this loop:
        *   [x] Clear the canvas.
        *   [x] Draw the webcam feed (if not already visible).
        *   [x] Draw the lava.
        *   [x] (Placeholder) Check for player "in lava" condition.
        *   [x] Update game UI (score, timer).
*   [x] **6.4. Implement Game Over Logic:**
    *   [x] Create a condition that triggers "Game Over" (e.g., based on the simplified interaction from Step 5.2, or a timer running out).
    *   [x] When "Game Over":
        *   [x] Stop the game loop.
        *   [x] Display final score/time.
        *   [x] Show a "Play Again" button.
*   [x] **6.5. Implement Restart Game Logic:**
    *   [x] When "Restart Game" is chosen, reset game variables and transition the state back to `Playing` (or `StartScreen`).

## Phase 7: Scoring and User Interface (UI)

*   [x] **7.1. Implement Timer/Score:**
    *   [x] In the `Playing` state, increment a timer or score variable over time.
*   [x] **7.2. Display Score/Timer:**
    *   [x] On the canvas, draw the current score and/or survival time. Make sure it's clearly visible.
*   [x] **7.3. Basic UI Elements:**
    *   [x] Ensure your "Start" and "Restart" buttons (if HTML-based) or clickable areas (if canvas-based) are functional.

## Phase 8: COMPLETED - 20x20 Lava Field Implementation

*   [x] **8.1. Calibration System:**
    *   [x] Add a calibration mode at game start
    *   [x] Allow user to click/tap the four corners of a 20x20 area on their floor
    *   [x] Store the four corner points for perspective mapping
*   [x] **8.2. Grid Generation:**
    *   [x] Implement bilinear interpolation to create a grid from the four corner points
    *   [x] Draw a 20x20 grid that maps to the real-world floor perspective
    *   [x] Add visual effects to make grid cells look like lava
*   [x] **8.3. Game Integration:**
    *   [x] Update collision detection to work with the new grid-based lava field
    *   [x] Add visual indicators for safe vs. dangerous grid cells
    *   [x] Implement transitions between calibration and gameplay

## Phase 9: COMPLETED - Body & Foot Detection Implementation

*   [x] **9.1. TensorFlow.js Model Selection:**
    *   [x] Selected MoveNet for its balance of speed and accuracy
    *   [x] Implemented model loading with appropriate error handling
*   [x] **9.2. Keypoint Extraction:**
    *   [x] Successfully loaded MoveNet model in `script.js`
    *   [x] Implemented webcam frame capture and pose estimation
    *   [x] Extracted all body keypoints including ankles
*   [x] **9.3. Foot Position Estimation:**
    *   [x] Enhanced ankle detection to estimate actual foot positions
    *   [x] Used knee-to-ankle vectors to project foot locations
    *   [x] Added visual indicators for foot positions
*   [x] **9.4. Grid Integration:**
    *   [x] Mapped foot positions to the calibrated 10x10 grid
